## About PersonaPal

PersonaPal is a modern web application that lets you create and interact with AI companions inspired by historical figures, entrepreneurs, or any personality you can imagine. Want to discuss relativity with Einstein, talk innovation with Elon Musk, or create your own unique AI companion? PersonaPal makes it possible.

Key Features:
- Create custom AI companions by providing:
  - Personality traits and background
  - Seed conversations that shape their behavior
  - Detailed descriptions of their knowledge and expertise
- Chat with AI companions created by the community
- Real-time conversations with context-aware responses
- User authentication and profile management
- Persistent chat history
- Vector-based memory system for more natural conversations
- Only a user who created the companion can edit it.

## Limitations
- Currently supports English language only
- Rate limit: 10 requests per 10 seconds
- All API services (OpenAI, Replicate, etc.) are on free tier with their respective limitations
- Chat may stop working soon as the free tier is very limited.
